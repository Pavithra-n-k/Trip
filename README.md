# **Trip to Florence Italy**
# **Introduction**
Welcome to my readme file about my recent trip to Florence, Italy.

My trip to Florence was **amazing**.
 The architecture and art were *incredible*, and the food was delicious.

 As Michelangelo once said,  
 > *"The true work of art is but a shadow of the divine perfection."*

 ###
 The trip was divided into three parts: **Sightseeing, Eating, and Shopping.**

Here are some of the things I did on my trip:
 * Visited Ponte Vecchio
* Ate at a local pizzeria <a id="#Eating"></a>
* Shopped for souvenirs at the San Lorenzo Market
